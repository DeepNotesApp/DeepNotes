        Comparing Obsidian and DeepNotes

          <b>Obsidian</b> is a note-taking application first released by Shida
          Li and Erica Xu in 2020 that works with Markdown files. It is similar
          to DeepNotes, especially after the introduction of Obsidian Canvas in
          2022.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both are designed for deep interlinking and nesting of notes. But,
          while Obsidian focuses on customizability, DeepNotes is more
          opinionated in its approach.
        </p>

        <p>Here is a detailed comparison of their features:</p>

          </td>
          <td>
            ✅ DeepNotes offers very flexible notes as a differentiator. Each
            note can have a head and a body, and can also be nested, collapsed,
            colored and linked with arrows.

          </td>
          <td>
            ✴️ One of the differentiators of DeepNotes is its unique page
            navigation system, which keeps track of the last path taken to reach
            each page. This allows the user to automatically build their page
            hierarchy by simply creating and navigating through their pages.

            conflicts and data loss. Syncing takes a few seconds to complete.

        <p>
          Obsidian and DeepNotes are both great note-taking and personal
          knowledge management apps. Each is really good at what it does.
          Obsidian is great at managing and linking information utilizing
          Markdown files, canvases, and its plugin ecosystem, while DeepNotes
          has a canvas-first approach, and innovates with its page navigation
          system and extremely flexible notes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, the choice between Obsidian and DeepNotes boils down to
          personal preference and the specific features that align with your
          workflow and note-taking style.
